<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">What is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">NDFD?</span><br>
<p>As the foundation of the NWS Digital Services Program, the National
Digital Forecast Database (NDFD) consists of gridded forecasts of
sensible weather elements (e.g., cloud cover, maximum temperature).
NDFD contains a seamless mosaic of digital forecasts from NWS field
offices working in collaboration with the National Centers for
Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The database is available for members
of the public to use in creating text, graphic, gridded and image
products of their own. Over time, NWS will offer a wider array of
gridded forecast elements and a larger set of graphical presentations.
Access to the data and a description of NDFD elements can be found
here. The experimental NDFD data is not an official NWS forecast
product.<br>
The Operations Concept for the NWS Digital Services describes the
transition the NWS is making as we implement the NDFD and presents our
strategies for provision of digital services to meet the evolving needs
of our customers and partners.<br>
<br>
Find out more about how and why the NDFD was created, the weather
elements in NDFD, verification and future plans. See the navigation bar
on the left for more links.<br>
